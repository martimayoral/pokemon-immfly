## ▶️ Run the app ▶️

I have uploaded a build of the app in [my web page](https://www.martimayo.com/demo/immfly/) so you don't have to serve it locally to test it. <br />
To clone it and run it locally it works like any other: Clone, install, and run (`npm start`). <br />
To run the tests execute  `npm test`. <br />
To build execute `npm run-script build`. This will create a folder `build` with the build.

## 🛠️ Features implemented 🛠️

I completed all features to implement as well as the bonus features.

### Features required

The web application shows a main pokemon list of the first generation (151 pokemon). The url is **/pokemon** and the background becomes gray on hover.

Each pokemon is displayed with its name and gif. <br />
The detail page **/pokemon/:name** works as expected, showing info about the pokemon desired. <br />
The application is responsive, clean, with attention to detail and 3d party packages have been avoided.

### Bonus features

### 🌟 Favourite pokemon

A new page has been created with the endpoint **/favourites** that allows the user to see their favourite pokemon. <br />
To set a pokemon as favourite, the user has to click the **star ⭐** icon next to it.

### 🔠 Filter by name

There is a input box for the user to filter pokemons by name. There is a **x** button to clear, as it is an standard *search* input.

### 💅 Styled-components

Styled components have been used.

### 🚦 Tests

To be able to test I used the framework [jest](https://jestjs.io/) along with the [react testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). I created a total of 17 unit tests for the components. <br />
There are mundane tests such as checking if the component is rendered, and also more elavorated ones that handle clicks or use Api mocks.

### 📃 Linter

The [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/) linter has been used.

### 🏗️ Custom webpack

A custom webpack has been used (see below for more information).

## 🗂️ Project Srtucture 🗂️

The project is structured by folders. Each folder containing its component and tests. The main structure is as follows:
```
-src/
---assets/
---components/
---contexts/
---layouts/
---pages/
---routes/
---styles/
``` 

## 🏗️ Webpack 🏗️

It had been a while since I didnt create a custom webpack. It was interesting to use all the new updates and functionalities that it provides. <br />
I used [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) with the basic and standard configuration for react projects (using [@babel/preset-react](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-react)). <br />
I also added a few details such as hashing the name of the output production script files or using a source-map to debug more easily.

## ♻️ Tests ♻️

Here are all the tests I did and their name:
